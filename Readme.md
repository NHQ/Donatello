# About

Donatello is a pure-CSS drawing library for the browser.

# Usage

# Status

Donatello is super-experimental, designed to see how far CSS could be streched to provide
general-purpose drawing functions in the browser. The API is in flux and capabilities may be added or 
removed. I don't want to duplicate what can be done by other libraries like jQuery 
or using native browser functionality. 

# Future work

API support for setting properties after drawing
Regular polygon
grouping, clipping
Bezier curves
bounding box, click/touch area calculations
arcs, paths
